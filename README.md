# hyperdimensional-playground

An exploration of Hyperdimensional vectors, word vectors, and reasoning based off of [Kanerva's paper](http://redwood.berkeley.edu/pkanerva/papers/kanerva09-hyperdimensional.pdf).

* example.clj - is a walkthrough of some of the main concepts.  It follows my blog post [Why Hyperdimensional Socks Never Match](http://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2016/02/06/why-hyperdimensional-socks-never-match/)
* context_vectors.clj - is an exploration of word vectors using a corpus of fairy tale stories from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/).  It includes example usage of word vector addition and reasoning.
